College quizz.
I provide data from directory "data":
- main.md Which containts the main content of the class
- vocabulary.md which has main keywords and definitions
- quiz.json which has questions and answers (with first one is always correct, will be randomized in app)

The view should start with listing semestres (check /data dir), inside semster there should be classes, then inside that class, there should be the option to view the Main material, see vocabulary, or take the quizz.
The quizz will show results at the end.
